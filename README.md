Flower Prediction using Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the species of a flower based on its features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The model is trained on a dataset (such as the famous Iris dataset) and can classify flowers into different species with high accuracy.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify a flower into one of several species (e.g., Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica) based on input features like the flower's petal and sepal measurements. The project uses supervised learning techniques, where a model is trained on labeled data and can predict the species for new, unseen data.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: The data is loaded, cleaned, and formatted for use in the machine learning algorithm. This includes handling missing values, normalizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Model Selection: Different machine learning algorithms are used for classification, such as:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Training the Model: The model is trained on the training set, using the features of the flowers to predict the target labels (flower species).

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess its performance on the testing set.

Deployment: Once the model achieves an acceptable level of accuracy, it can be used to predict flower species from new data.

Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-Learn (for machine learning algorithms)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
Key Features
